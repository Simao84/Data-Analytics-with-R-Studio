## Overview
This project aims to analyze tourist arrivals in Switzerland from 2005 to 2023, focusing on the most visited destinations by both domestic and international guests. By linking tourist behaviors with weather patterns across different cantons, the study seeks to provide insights into the dynamics of tourism in Switzerland, which can help policymakers and businesses in decision-making.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. How has tourism evolved from 2005 to 2023?
2. Which continent and sources provide the highest number of tourists to Switzerland?
3. Which season has the highest total tourist arrivals in Switzerland, and how do domestic and international arrivals compare across the seasons?
4. How have domestic and international tourist arrivals in Switzerland changed over time, and what was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these trends?
5. What are the most visited cantons in Switzerland by domestic and international tourists? And which cantons have the least arrivals?
6. What is the total number of domestic tourist arrivals compared to international tourist arrivals? And which group of tourists (domestic or international) had more total arrivals in Switzerland?
7. Which cantons are the most and least popular among international tourists during different seasons?
8. Do tourists, both domestic and international, prefer Switzerlandâ€™s Alpine regions or its urban areas, and how do these preferences vary by season?
9. How does the weather impact tourist dynamics in Switzerland?

## Data Sources
The data used for this project comprises two key datasets:
1. [**Tourist Arrivals Data**](https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/en/px-x-1003020000_102/-/px-x-1003020000_102.px/): Data from 2005 to 2023, containing detailed tourist arrivals by canton, year, and source country (local and international tourists).
2. [**Weather Data**](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/#tab=forecast-map): Provides weather information from 14 different weather stations, covering the major climatic regions of Switzerland.

## Project Structure
The R Markdown document is structured as follows:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of Switzerland's tourism industry and the purpose of the project.
2. **Data preparation**: Loads and cleans the tourism and weather datasets, handling missing values and merging the datasets.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analysis of key variables (Arrivals, Temperature, and Precipitation) to identify trends, patterns, and key statistical features.
4. **Visualization**:
    - Visualizes the evolution of tourism over the years.
    - Analyzes tourist origins by continent and country.
    - Investigates seasonality in tourist arrivals.
    - Examines the impact of COVID-19 on tourism trends.
    - Compares domestic and international tourist arrivals.
5. **Weather Impact Analysis**: Correlates weather patterns with tourist arrivals across different seasons.
6. **Conclusions**: Summarizes key findings.

## Technologies and Libraries
This project is developed using R, leveraging the following libraries and packages:
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization and plotting.
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation and aggregation.
- `tidyr`: For data tidying.
- `lubridate`: For handling date and time-based operations.
- `readr`: For reading data from CSV and text files.
- `knitr`: For creating reports and rendering the analysis output in multiple formats.
- `minidown`: For customized markdown document rendering.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Pre-requisites**: Ensure R is installed on your machine. Install the required packages by running:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "lubridate", "readr", "knitr", "minidown"))
   
## Key Insights
**Tourism Growth**: Switzerland has seen substantial growth in both international and domestic tourist arrivals from 2005 - 2023.

**Pandemic Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop in tourist arrivals, with varying rates of recovery across regions.

**Weather Impact**: Temperature has a strong influence on tourist arrivals, with higher temperatures correlating to more visits. Precipitation does not significantly impact arrival numbers.

## Future Work
1. Incorporating additional datasets, such as hotel occupancy rates or tourist expenditures.
2. Exploring the role of extreme weather events on tourism.
3. Investigating specific marketing or policy interventions to boost tourism in under-visited cantons.

## Usage
This analysis is designed for:

1. Tourism researchers studying trends in Swiss tourism.
2. Policymakers understanding the impact of seasonality and weather on tourism.
3. Businesses in the tourism industry seeking insights into customer behavior.
